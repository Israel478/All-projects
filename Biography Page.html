            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>My name is Israel Bekele. I was born in january 01/2006, in Ethiopia Debre Ziyte city. From my childwood time I want to be a professional Football player and I want to write a great hitory in my career. In this intention I was growing up and in my 16 age time I start train like professional player with my personal Coach. At this progress I was changing in all things and my body was transffering into stronge mucles. At the age of 17 in 2023, I was tried a trial in Ethiopia Medhin FC but I didn't pass to join the team, after a few months I was joined Bishoftu Kenema second team. In that year I had a bad injury I damaged my tibia, that was so so bad time to me because I was lost many chances to join a big team, it was so hard to me to lose that great chance, but with my personal Coach help I came back after 4 months bad time and train to be fit to play football agin. After one month hard personal training I got my fit back and start playing football in high intensity. I didn't give up by my football career with God one I will be pro and make a great history.    </p>
